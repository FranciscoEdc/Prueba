    <h1>TailsOS</h1>
    <p>Translations:[<a href="tailsos_es.html">ES</a>],[<a href="tailsos_pt-eu.html">PT-EU</a>]</p>
    <p>ItÂ´s a Debian-based Linux distribution that offers anonimity via Tor, without leaving any fingerprint on the utilised device</p>
    <h2>1. Routing through the Tor network</h2>
    <p>To avoid malicious third-parties from spying our internet activity, TailsOS routes everything through the Tor network, besides the own Tor browser.</p>
    <h2>2. Amnesic OS</h2>
    <p>TailsOS is installed on an USB drive, from which you boot the OS. Once you shutdown or reboot the PC, all your activity done there will be cleared.</p>
    <h2>3. Portability</h2>
    <p>Since you boot the US from an external drive, you can use it on any allowed system.</p>
    <h2>4. Decent app kit</h2>
    <p>By default TailsOS contains many apps for any activity you may perform, like the Tor browser, Thunderbird, Pigeon, Monero, etc. If you want to use apps that aren't included, install them on persistent memory.</p>
    <h2>5. Persistent memory</h2>
    <p>If you want to save files or apps that aren't included by default, you can create a persistent memory on the external drive to store anything under encryption to preserve it even after shutting-down the PC.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Misunderstandings</h2>
    <p>Despite utilities like Tor being associated with crime, they're also useful for domestic abuse victims, civilians under oppressive regimes, activists & journalists to improve their situation & those around to protect themselves from malicious people. Terrorists & narcotrafficants don't avoid Whatsapp like fire for any reason.</p>
